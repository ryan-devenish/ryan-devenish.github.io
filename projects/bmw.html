            <div class="description">
                <p><a>What if BMW decided to move from a rich history of mechanical precision found in their dashboard gauges, and adopt the flexibility a digital display can provide?</p>
                <p><a>That was exactly the premise when BMW engaged Smart Design to concept their digital instrument cluster.</a></p>

                Communicate to the driver the different modes that encompass three distinct methods of driving.<br>
                Create a feedback &amp; response loop between the vehicle and its driver, to give him recommendations on how to achieve peak efficiency.<br>
                Come up with something we haven’t seen before.

                Rotated dials allow for a more efficient use of screen space, opening up the middle of the display for driver assistance and status information.<br>
                Needles are replaced with areas of color to enhance peripheral legibility and demand less visual focus.<br>
                Ambient feedback on the driver’s current efficiency status is consistently presented in both Sport and Eco modes.

                <span class="title">Comfort Mode</span>
                It’s about leisure and pleasure driving–the Sunday cruise. The car informs the driver about what to expect, and prepares him for any condition, making the driver feel comfortable in his surroundings, in and outside the vehicle.
                This mode provides a flexible space, customizable by the driver and his personal preference while not limiting the information that’s needed right now.

                A feedback loop is created between the car and the driver recommending proper driving technique and feeding that information back to the driver so he can adjust.
                <br>
                All about achievement and communication. How many miles can I squeeze out of a single tank? How does my driving affect my car?
